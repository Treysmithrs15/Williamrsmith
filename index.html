<p><strong>About Me</strong></p>
  
<p style=" "border:3px; border-style:double; border-color:#FF0000; padding: 1em;"> I was born on December 16th 1999, and I grew up in northern Virginia, Kansas City, and Dallas, Texas. I am a finance major at UT Asutin, and I like sports, music, animals, real estate, and marketing. I have played tennis since the age of three and was varsity team captain in high school, but now much prefer skiing, golfing, and football.</p>
